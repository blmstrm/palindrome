==========

Java classes that finds the biggest palindrome being a product of two factors of n digits.

To compile & install the project, type:

The jar file obtained if executed will calculate and display the biggest palindrome being a product of two 3-digit numbers.

Through alterations of the sourcecode the method ''''findPalindrome(long nDigits)'''' can take any valid ''''long'''' as input and will compute the biggest palindrome as a product of two factors with nDigits digits.
Should a ''''long'''' overflow happen the program will halt.
